## [[Empire of Thylyist|Empire of Thylyist]]
Former city-state, grown to the size of a empire. 
The City of Thylyist is their capital, and epicentre of their official religion, the [[Followers of Mekhane]], originally conceived as bunker-fort installation shortly before the end of the [[Nølkā-Mekhanite War]].
Their government is practically defunct. Instead, the religious elite ([[Followers of Mekhane|Mekhanites]]), and to a extend, the [[Thylyian Military]] is de-facto ruling. The fanatical devotion impacts everyday life and has frozen technological and scientific progress, leaving them stuck in steam technology. However, this has been highly refined, leading to complex automata and other steampunk machinery. 
## [[Frisco Bay Confederation]]
Conglomerate of various cities, situated in the [[Frisco Bay]].
Originally founded by outcasts of Thylyist, who have been expelled due to ”heresy”[^1].
They freed themselves off the religious constraints, and are thus advancing at steady pace. Current marvels of their craft involve [[Electricity]], the [[Development of Petrochemistry]] and [[Development of Printing]]. 
Effectively the strongest, both economically and military, force, notably due to their intense naval operations at [[Brisburne]], and the extensive [[Servilian Railroad and Train Network]]. 

[^1]:  Beliefs in more liberal economy, unrestrained science and technology and democracy. 

## [[Davern Kingdom]]

## [[Nølkā]]/[[Ancients]]
A religion concentrated into a artificial mountain valley mound, following the aftermath of the [[Nølkā-Mekhanite War]]. Originally a continent-spanning religious empire which worshipped the creation, mankind of flesh. They aspired to devour gods and obtain their power through [[Apotheosis]].
