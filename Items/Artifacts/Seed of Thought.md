*Item Lore:*

It is incredibly thought-provoking, and is capable of releasing one's mind from all cultural, social and political restraints.

Â 

Many ancient books of empires and other non-democracies express a violent fear of these seeds, as they are almost bound to cause coups or revolutions when sown.

Plant this seed and cause the government of Thylyist to fall.
