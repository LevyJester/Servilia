An impressive tome bound in once-polished, rusted iron plates set with a fractured emerald. It was written by the wizards and sages of the [[Athenaeum of Sorcery]]. It's sheer weight and appearance raised many rumours in arcane societies, and it is said to hold secrets about sailing the [[Eternal Sea]]. 

It can be opened without issue, however, it is written in a scripture that you can't read, it feels like it is actively trying to escape your mind.
Though, you can easily identify that it has a abundance of technical schematics and ritual circles written within. Some of these circles project themselves onto the floor through the emerald, however, they're massively flawed. 
Many of the technical diagrams seem to resemble various naval vessels, but with massively oversized sails of unknown fabric.
