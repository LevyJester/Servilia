#equipment #Thylyist 

A finely crafted armour, fuelled by clockwork and steam. With a steady supply of energy it becomes a truly intimidating piece of machinery on the battlefield.

Sentinel power amour, stolen from the [[Central Thylyist Armoury]]. One of the most powerful and strongest marvels of contemporary technology. Highly modular and customisable, plead for a hearing with [[War Constructor Borange Olbaz]] for upgrades and modification. 

Possession of this asset is condemned, as the Sentinels, and by that extend, the entire Thylyian Military consider this technology top secret and *will* send the Hounds.  

AC: 14, if powered, +7 str, +3 dex, +15m, 10 res to BLDG/PIERC/SLASH
