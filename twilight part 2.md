casual rambling as uusal
so
to conduct twilight you'll need this odd ass implant which-
ugh
1. get implant working
2. be capable of tapping the twilight (you're causing a localised rift in spacetime in/on the implant)
3. channel that juice through your body 
4. give it intent through your focused thought
5. call to the elemental force you want to use by sacrificing a pellet of material 
	stuff like gemstones, animal components, metals, idfk 
6. get that intent-indented elemental juice into your articulation (glove/hands, speech)
7. produce the Woven, the confined and suspended spell through articulation such as gestures or incantation
8. release the woven into the spell you want to do 
	1. **OR** take the woven and cast/cram it into a Cypher for later use

also
tl;dr organic and natural materials conduct twilit best, getting worse until aversion/drawbacks the further it is refined
flesh, biomass, living bodies, leather, fabric, minerals, ores, gem\*stones, pure metals (commonly copper, silver, iron/steel, beryllium bronze, brass)
following tierlist (best to worst):
1. Living bodies
2. Flesh
3. Other biomass/organic tissues
4. Fabric
5. Leather

6. Minerals and solid sediments
7. Gems and Gemstones, commonly processed and polished
