## Turn Structure
- The Option to Jail/Exile someone
	A exiled/jailed person is unable to participate for one cycle. Exile is voluntary, jail is decided upon by the public or the jailer. 
- Construction
	On a unanimous vote, a new building may be created, and possibly house a new citizen (to get a deceased player back).
## Added Roles
- Jailer
	Role that is elected upon, can forcibly put someone in jail. 
- Pyromaniac
	Gets to burn down a building, once per game. 
- Necromancer
	Can revive a dead person once a game. May consult the dead (Ask a single question per turn to a dead person). 
- Cursed Villager
	Upon killing by werewolves, they turn into a werewolf themselves.
## Buildings
The concept of buildings behaves as following:
Every person is assigned a building, which acts as their residence and workplace.
- Peasantâ€™s Hut
	Does nothing. 
- Jail
	Home of the Jailer, and where the detained reside.
