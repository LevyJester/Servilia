A malicious spectre haunting a true good (but destined to be evil/dark) character, eventually and gradually destroying their body
Said character is getting furious and devotes self to a religion in search for a remedy, in ignorance of them getting a free salvation from the mortal coil
The spectre is tasked with bringing this soul into the otherside realm in order to evade some fate that would've killed the person at one point or another 
Eventual revelation of character and conversion of belief to eternal thankfulness and regret regarding hatred and spite for the spectre

The spectre was specifically created/conjured to haunt this person, and is, unlike other ethereals, artificial/young and didn't shuttle between the otherworld and material plane (which makes it a rather odd one without the millennia of existence)
