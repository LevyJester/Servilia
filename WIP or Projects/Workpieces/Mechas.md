something about mecha, rambling time
mechs (mobile entity combat hybrids) fill these roles:
- oversized exoskeleton, piloted by soldiers
- main battle tank equivalent on six/eight legs, autonomous entity with rationale intellect
- scout unit using digitigrade bipedal stride, barely armoured but extremely agile, hybrid piloting (soldiers + AI)

different branch for aerial combat, [[Aerial Combat Vehicle/Entity]], respectively if they're piloted or autonomous
