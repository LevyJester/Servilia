the present effectively is a zealous/religious empire worshipping a dead machine-god, and the future is a cyberpunk hyperdystopic corrupt megapolis


and this addition would provide a sensical bridge for the empire of Thylyist to decay from the insides though the hands of the True Machinists to the futuristic Amida and all that entails


originally, in the past, their god fought in wars and “died”, fell into pieces, who got scattered across the lands and times, with the religion as task to reassemble them
they ended up betraying this quest and became sick with power


effectively, through recent events, a splinter group of Mekhane’s Followers has gained notable influence and power, driven by their belief that the followers are abusing and raping the blessed machine, against it’s divine purpose


thylyist in it’s current state is said religious preacher elite caste holding a iron grip over their citizens, enforcing propaganda and doctrine, all in the name of their god who has been reduced into a tool for their rhetorics


these true machinists strive to break the dogmata of regression and paralysis of developing, while also rejecting the human flesh, their very selves as embrace to the blessed machine (“from the moment i understood the weakness of my flesh…”)

so the True Machinists are scheming to overthrow the Followers and their warriors to embrace the outside world again, as they have been locked down in their fortifications for generations
