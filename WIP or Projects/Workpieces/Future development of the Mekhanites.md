They'll see that the Machine will betray them, rust, fall apart. 
The [[True Machinists]] were mistaken; [[His Design]] is flawed.
They will turn to the silicon, to what makes computers: [[Holy Code]]. 
They will try to strip their physical body, become one with the [[Runtime]]. 
Each will become the very first [[Numerator]], entrapped in steel, silicon and misshapen flesh, but promised to exist forevermore.
There will be no flaws, for [[The Debugger]] is flawless.
