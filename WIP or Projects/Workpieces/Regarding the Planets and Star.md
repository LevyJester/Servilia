I puzzled this together at 1am, forgive me
most of the present solar system is polished to the degree where I need it to be, with the planet and it's three moons having the most attention
any other planet has only been named and described through what is visible using simpler optics 
schi, the planet itself, is only described on one continent since the residents of this continent named servilia can't leave [[Edge of Hope]].
it's simply toto much work for me to create and maintain more continents, all with trying to be unique cultures and whatnot
therefore, only one continent, but if you so have thematically fitting ideas, please lmk
