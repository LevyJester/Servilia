edge of hope is actually the edge of the perceived space/eternal sea?

something about a metaphorical window representing the peephole of the soul to the world, which could be broken somehow (possible metaphor for transcendence)

soul theory:
	each soul is only a visitor from a realm beyond, only tied into the mortal shell
	souls without any coherence and such enter a state of degenerate matter, known as [[Amarisk]]
	this opens the question of "where are souls formes" or "where does amarisk gain coherence to become a soul"
	and the question of "where does the soul go after the death of it's shell" is answered by the entire dilemma of the undead and Charon being disabled 
	possibly the afterlives are also dysfunctional, same as the rivers Archon and Styx
