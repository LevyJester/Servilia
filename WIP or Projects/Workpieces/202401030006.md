edge of hope is actually the edge of the perceived space/eternal sea?

something about a metaphorical window representing the peephole of the soul to the world, which could be broken somehow (possible metaphor for transcendence)

soul theory:
	each soul is only a visitor from a realm beyond, only tied into the mortal shell
	souls without any coherence and such enter a state of degenerate matter, known as [[Amarisk]]
	this opens the question of "where are souls formes" or "where does amarisk gain coherence to become a soul"
	and the question of "where does the soul go after the death of it's shell" is answered by the entire dilemma of the undead and Charon being disabled 
	possibly the afterlives are also dysfunctional, same as the rivers Archon and Styx
## baseline reality timeline
mekhane and yalgabaoth create humanity
conflict ensues after millennia of peace 
the [[Nølkā-Mekhanite War]] is fought, resulting in diaspora and destruction of all involved
during all this, the lavish vaulted and hid away all their resources and units 
... (time passes)
the Nølkā are banished into the ancient exile, with the mountains rising for them
	their isolation causes them to shape their unique culture, while the few remaining Nølkā remain bitter and resentful 
### diverging branch
here, after the war, the mekhanites ally with the lacish
Frisco bay confederation was never founded
the alliance instead manages to assemble mekhane again 
in this timeline, mekhane guides humanity (and in turn, the lavish) to arcane engineering, eventually leading up to arcane engineering 
eventually, spelljammers are devised as means to travel across the eternal sea 
### mainline reality
the mekhanites bunch up in thylylist after the war, starting their descent into isolationism
the [[Betrayal]] happens, effectively empowering the morally bankrupt "enlightened" priests etc
information from before the war is preserved and kept undisclosed and inaccessible to the public, effectively stripping the populace of any awareness of their history and surroundings
	this leaves them very susceptible to the tall tales and outright propaganda and misinformation campaigns 
pseudoneo species are captured and terribly abused into bloodlust-driven monsters of violence and war
the council realises the immense potential on these beings and decides to eradicate the Lavish Empire using the last stockpiles of magical weapons from before the war, and more importantly, the armies of automatons left over and dotted across the landscape ([[Sentinel of Steel]])
		beinging forth the [[Fall]]/[[Fall of the Lavish]]
★time passes

the Frisco bay confederation is founded from refugees and other stragflers, placing themselves №1 in scientific and economic development i
