Hello, dearest friend. 
(Today's the 14th September 2023.)
I've just created a folder called Clash's stuff, where i'll keep your texts, but i'll take/move out the various bigger files like music (since i do not want to bloat this folder from 80mb to 2gb). 
This is a polite request to place mostly topical stuff in here. 
I'm assuming you're new here, so please read the [Documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Home), it's incredibly handy. The markdown formatting from discord using * and # applies, and you can use either `[display text](link)` or `[[link|display text]]` (if you're in edit mode, of course without the backticks/accents). You can also escape/nullify formatting with a backslash. 
You got a lil' book icon in the top right, which toggles between reader and editor mode. Reader mode makes all the symbols vanish and makes it look a bit neater, and hides \%%comments\%%. 

I took the liberty of converting (and translating via deepl.com) the odt/whatever files into markdown so that i can read them from within here, hope you don't mind. (I didn't delete them, though. )

Oh my, did you write the text on altruism yourself? 
That surely is a **chonky** train of thought, whew.

I'm split on erotic/sexual content in this project, regardless if it is within the world or [just the two of us](https://open.spotify.com/track/1ko2lVN0vKGUl9zrU0qSlT).

In case you actually try to read any of the stuff we made, here's a quick rundown of the folders:
- Beings
	- This is the category in which all creatures, NPCs, characters, species, races, and such are.
- Factions and cultures
	- The political powers, religions, cults and other organisations.
	- Cultures kinda overlap with species at some point, I haven't figured out a neat solution yet.
- History
	- Probably where this project is lacking the most, a coherent history and timeline, WIP. 
	- Quests are sorted in here, as well as the older parts of the lore, which has been under constant changing. 
- Items
	- Weapons, potions, crafting components, armour, etc. You know the deal. 
- Media
	- The folder for all Media like maps, Heraldry, dungeon layouts, and so on and so forth. 
- Realms
	- I apologise for the horrible tree sub-structuring, but i felt it was necessary (given this...)![[Cosmology of Planes v1.png]]
	- This is where all the areas, locations, planets, moons, whatever is stored. it's a lot of stuff. 
- Structure
	- Almost the "misc stuff" folder, with stuff idk where to put it elsewhere. 
	- Has the big and almighty TODO file, beware. 
- Temp, Migration
	- The old and scuffed files from my onenote folder before i migrated to obsidian, mostly redundant at this point. 
- the rest
	- Basically anything unsorted in here is either a orphan (no relation to existing stuff) or WIP (where i couldn't be asked to sort it.)
