#Lunatics #Religion  #Faction 

The deranged and off brand sorcerers residing in [Stargard](City%20of%20Stargard).
Capable of teaching the party the magic of the stars, ~~star signals~~ if they can understand them (must know ancient, celestial and draconic) and are resilient to the memetic corruption they give off.
They are rather skilled in optics, masonry and glassblowing, as their magic requires them to be. 


Â 
Some of them replaced their [[Iron Oculus|eyes]] with crystalline lenses or similar implants, designed to view the sky with higher quality than the ordinary eye.
Highly afraid of light, and nocturnal.
At times they scowl at the sheer mention of light.

They are somewhat able to predict future events by calculating celestial body alignment. Through this, they saw *things* that took their sanity.
They can offer valuable information if their babble and insanity can be deciphered.
