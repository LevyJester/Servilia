It's a semiamorphous organism residing in the [[Northern Reaches]] of the Realm, especially the Poles.

It feeds on thermal energy (heat),  [[Twilight]] and Amarisk residues. 



Archenemy towards the [[Children of The Flame]], as their goals are antipolar. 

It's main way of existing is to convert any matter into its own tissue, which is necrotic and frozen: [[Premature Heart of Cold]], [[Ice Cub]]. 

Small patches (like, 20g, 5x5x5cm) can survive on their own and possibly develop on into independent instances.

# Third Era utilisation
Numerators and the rediscovered Lavish biotechnology made it possible to harness the various qualities of Cold tissue, while somewhat being able to tame the drawbacks. 
Cold tissue finds widespread application in high-temperature machinery where resilient cooling is required and within numerators, where it's stem-cell pluripotency is utilised to shape the central infrastructure of Numerators.
