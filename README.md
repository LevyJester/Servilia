A slightly oversized and overdone worldbuilding project, singlehandedly done by me. 
Originally designed as D&D(ish) + Homebrew setting, has expanded out and beyond that ever since. 
There’s no coherent theme aside from “the world is horrible yet we keep on pushing” and issues arising from that, so, have fun! 
Start here: 
- [[Faction Overview]]
- [[Things that Need Fixing]]
* For the magic system, consider reading around [[Twilit]] and [[Twilit Casting]]. 
* Lifeforms and species are described in [[Species of Servilia]]. 
A coherent story/timeline is yet to come. 
So far, the #Overviews tag should be pretty self-explanatory and helpful. 

For best reading experience, I highly advocate [Obsidian]([https://obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)) as editor/reader, since it enables various widely-used features like file links, tags and alike. 

Various other things exist here as well due to me using this as Notepad, but you're better off ignoring it.
