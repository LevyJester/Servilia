Each soul is only a visitor from [[A Realm Beyond]], only tied into the mortal shell.
Souls without any coherence and such enter a state of degenerate matter, known as [[Amarisk]] or [[Spirits]]. Exposure to too much entropy and chaos can deteroriate souls, deform them until they cannot reside in a physical body anymore, but need special procedures ([[Birth of Energy]]) to be materialised. 

This opens the question of "Where are souls formed?" and "Where does amarisk gain coherence to become a soul?" and "Is it possible to reverse the deformation of a soul?"
And the question of "Where does the soul go after the death of it's shell?" is answered by the entire dilemma of the Undead and Charon being disabled;
	That being the soul being unable to depart from the mortal vessel, thus being forced to reside in the decaying body which is leeching this soul's power. 
Possibly the [[Afterlives]] are also dysfunctional, same as the rivers [[Acheron]] and [[Styx]].
