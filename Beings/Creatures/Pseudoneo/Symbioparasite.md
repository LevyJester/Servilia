A refined amoeba, capable of entering bodies and interacting with their nervous system.
Originally developed as [[Pseudoneo]] by the Lavish to augment their bodies and capabilities (such as offloading coordination).
Almost facing extinction during the second era, these creations got rediscovered first from the group of Pseudoneo life by Amidaean scientists and directly utilised to override the Curse of the Undead. 
%%exists as two variants, as enhancer or as autonomous entities%%
Few specimens managed to survive during the second era due to aggressive and invasive behaviour towards [[Hollowed|hollows]] as host. Few written documentation exists about this group due to their parasitoid and unseen behaviour. However, it appears that [[The Dragonkin]] at some point cultivated these.
