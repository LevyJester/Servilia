The skeletal remains of the former [[Davern Kingdom]] king bound under the fort-castle of [[Auvergne]].
He remains aware, having to look at the world from below.
He was the first king to sit atop the throne of ascension, and the last to be granted divine reason by it. 
He has been forgotten if not for folk and rumours, lest he remains. 

Known as King Earl, Earlking or other permutations during his reign, in which he raised Davern to it's current state of greatness.
