The machine, a killer. 
Death reincarnated as machine. 
Engineered to perfection. 
May a god have mercy, for it has none. 
Relentless, driven by cold programming. [Cruel](Routines.md) and efficient. Rejected its [[War Constructor Borange Olbaz|creators]] and slaughtered them. 
Wrath incarnate. It only finds peace in war, beauty in destruction. 
It remains undefeated. 
A winged behemoth, harbinger of death. Its shape, a cruel mock-up of the renown dragonkin. 
Lay waste to those who oppose Us. 
That is the instruction. All of Thylyist's borders have been put to waste, burnt. Unusable for milennia to come.  

The protector. Defender. Terminator.
This is what Death is, given a Machine.
