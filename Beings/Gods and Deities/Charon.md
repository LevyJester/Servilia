There he stands, he who rules the dreary transit. 
A sordid, wretched god: down from his hairy chin 
A length of beard descends, neglected, uncombed, unclean. 
His eyes, like fiery kilns, burnt with seeing the vermin he bears. 
A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire.

The Ferryman, he who hauls the souls of the deceased to the [[Afterlives]]. 
He who makes the voyage across Styx and Acheron and the between, on a flimsy boat, [[gifted to him]].
