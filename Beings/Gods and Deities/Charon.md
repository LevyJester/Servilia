There he stands, he who rules the dreary transit. 
A sordid, wretched god: down from his hairy chin 
A length of beard descends, neglected, uncombed, unclean. 
His eyes, like fiery kilns, burnt with seeing the vermin he bears. 
A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire.
***
The Ferryman, he who hauls the souls of the deceased to the [[Afterlives]] over [[Styx]] and across [[Acheron]]. 
He rides on a flimsy boat, [[gifted to him]].  During the Transit, he judges the souls through deception and interrogation. Most souls consider it a solace, as the transit is drear and dire.
