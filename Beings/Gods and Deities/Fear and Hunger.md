The god of Fear and Hunger, relating to the [[Apocalyptic Quartet]] of Death, Famine, War and Conquest. 
Arose from a human vessel which only experienced fear and hunger in its short life, who's been ended through ritual means.  
The few worshippers of this deity are typically struck with misery and pray for a betterment of their situation through a divine act. 
Actively rejected as foul and wrong by most, if not all organized religions, as this deity only brings misery and drags attention of the Apocalyptic Quartet. 

No living person has ever bestowed their gaze upon the personification of misery, lest few who experienced hallucinations described *it* as starved, deformed humanoid, standing tall regardless.
