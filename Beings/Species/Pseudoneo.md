The category for lifeforms and beings created by [[The Lavish Empire|Lavish]] scientists as smart, self-directed workforce, typically for tasks outside of their reach of the [[Palga Basin]], and by extend, the [[Astral Ocean]] and [[Sea Major]].
A relatively common, shared trait amongst pseudoneo zoophytes is the combination of higher life, plant life and [[Arcane Engineering]] into a single, autonomous and self-supplying unit. 

Many pseudoneo beings can source their energy from both biomass/food and sunlight (photosynthesis), whereas specimens utilising concentrated electricity or the arcane are rare, but present.

Through the aeons of creation and experience, the sheer variety of Pseudoneos has led to them being classified as own phylum by modern-day Friscoan researchers. 

It has to be mentioned that Dwarves took upon a central role of this phylum as those capable of modifying another individual's body. This self-augmentation led to a staggering freedom of expression and customisation across the entire phylum.
