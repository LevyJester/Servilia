In their gluttony for power, on the road to [[Apotheosis]], the [[Nølkā]] devoured all that is divine, including [[Schi ut-Pula]]/[[Possible reasons why Schi-Ut-Pula vanished]]. 
The massive power vacuum on the spaces [[Beyond]] allowed [[New Gods]] to rise to power, all bearing the imprint of a terrified and directionless mankind, instilled with fear. 

On the flipside, the complete lack of direction allows [some people](Frisco%20Bay%20Confederation) to develop freely, stripping the shackles of the past and pushing onwards.
