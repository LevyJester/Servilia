### Overview
The specialised brigade of the [[Gearforged Vanguard]], unshackled from the regressive preachings of the Mekhanites. 
Tasked to channel His Design into machines that kill, maim and burn, this ward holds the responsibility of many-a such creations, reckless and carefree of the impact of their monstrosities.  ^87a079
### People involved
Despite being among the highest secrets of Thylyist, one or two names slipped into the general public.
It is known that [[War Constructor Borange Olbaz]] is among their highest ranks.
