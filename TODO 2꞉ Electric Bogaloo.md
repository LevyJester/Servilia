the old one was getting too crammed for my own comfort so here we are

i’m going to handle this more of a random brainstorming page than anything, for the time being

# Charon
The ferryman charon, he who transfers the souls of the deceased, was rendered unable to execute his job (somehow).
so i’m assuming it is in relation to god-became nolka in cooperation with a group of varuu that they managed to either incapacitate charon or his boat or the rivers Styx and Acheron.
(Styx is the river that connects the material plane to the `cosmic foam`, and Acheron springs from the end of styx into the afterlives.)

> There Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast –  
> A sordid god: down from his hairy chin  
> A length of beard descends, uncombed, unclean;  
> His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire;  
> A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire.[15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon#cite_note-15)
