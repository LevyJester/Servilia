Engineers and tinkerers of Duley are currently prototyping a machine that can "print" books en masse. It is projected that this machine, dubbed Book Press, will enter commercial service in about a year. However, early prototype builds have shown that it is not capable of recreating arcane writing.

Currently, the [[The Cats' Scriptorium|feline scribes]] have claimed the rights on the first models, which have been built for feline anatomy.
