Idea: some Scientists (known as [[The Cradle]]) from [[Amida]] travel back in time and bring THEM the capability to travel time or switch timelines

TL;DR they will eventually arrive to cause the fall of [[The Second Era]], initiating the transition of Thylyist into Amida. 

Gotta balance this shit lmao

Possibly an ancient artefact, maybe a time-linked [[Riftstones]] would allow for the initial contact.
