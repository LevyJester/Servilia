#History

%%Gorgo%% 
Notable events are described in [[Before the First Era]]. 
#### Alliance and Peace
The time during which Humans, Lavish and all others coexisted without conflict or war.
Alliances and collaborations between species were common, science and magic were thriving. 

Lasted around {1200 earthen years}. 

Thylyist was founded in this era, and sprawled around the Lower Plains. 
Lavish inland already existed and already was thriving in [[Syksa, Lavish Capital]].
	Pseudoneo development and 'production'/genesis peaked in this time. 
Dragonkin were looked upon for their extensive knowledge and bodily strength. 

Knowledge was widely shared, preserved and broadened by groups such as the [[Erudition Coven]] and other organisations, which [still exist today.](Archive%20of%20Old.md) Notably, during the later parts of the first Era, Humanity/Thylyist took inspirations from Lavish biotechnology and combined it with their remnants of Mekhane into powerful, vastly beneficial bio-mechanical machinery and constructs. 


The Curse of Undead is known, but barely present (only about 5 from 100 deceased stay alive), those undying remain functional in society and are accepted widely.  

The end of the First Era was foreshadowed by the Thylyian order to redirect the Fountainhead to erect the Mountains to contain the Ancients. 
After the forcible gathering of apotheotic Nølkā and similar entities/people within the erected mountains, Thylyist turned the vast armadas of Pseudoneo entities against the lavish and [[Varuú]], and then issued them to execute themselves, effectively reverting all progress made since the inception.
