A comprehensive summary of Cults, Organised Religions and other followings present in Servilia. 
Loosely sorted by impact and known member count. 

## [[Followers of Mekhane]]
One of the two big religions ever formed in Servilia, this religion descended from the remnants of their once-great Mekhanite religion. 
Originally created as direct worshippers of [[Mekhane]]s will at the conception of Mankind, now turned into a lesser, deviated hodgepodge, in which their highest ranks assume the positions of dictatorship. 
After the [[Nølkā-Mekhanite War]], they broke down, scrambled at the destruction of their god, Mekhane. Having received the order to restore and [[His Divine Reassembly|to put him back together]], they set out in massive reconissance operations to retrieve parts at all costs, but eventually gave up, eventually curling up into the [[Empire of Thylyist]], a locked-down isolationist state where free speech and thought is rare. 

## [[Nølkā]]
The other big religion, directly [[Prime Clash of Nolka vs Mekhanites|opposing]] the Mekhanites. Mostlz untied from a deity, but rather oriented around becoming their own gods through [[Apotheosis]]. Their only notable figure is their lost prophet, who attempted to topple and kill [[Yaldabaoth]], the Chaos-Mother of Mankind. 
Survived the War barely, now is scattered across the continent in loose village groups and within the [[Ancient Exile]].
