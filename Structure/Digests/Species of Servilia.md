### [[Symbioparasite]]
Amorphous organisms capable of entering and residing with another being, easily resembles amobae. Originally engineered as enhancement and supplement to sensory and cognitive capabilities, some of these have turned independent and became rabid killers, taking over hosts and using them to spread themselves.
They are facing extinction, since the violent kind has caused significant hunts and orders of Kill On Sight, as the benevolent branch is too fragile to sustain itself out in the wild.
