## Population
Ongoing poverty, failing harvests, plummeting quality and standards of life. Absence of maintenance towards public interests such as trade routes, water infrastructure and security (i.e. protection from theft, burglary and assassinations) is giving raise to [[Organised Crime]].    
## Council
Those parts of the council that aren’t completely proxy figures to the Mekhanites are becoming increasingly corrupt and influenced by various wealthy organisations and merchants guilds.
## [[Followers of Mekhane|Mekhanites]]
Escalating fanaticism into a spiral of delusional worship, which makes them blind towards the consequences of their actions-> [[Stressors on Factions#Population]]. 
Moreso the isolationism and deviation from their quest of [[His Divine Reassembly]]  is raising insecurities among the broader masses of their adherents, as this is their supposed ideal goal and strife, now becoming increasingly volatile. 
Additionally, a [[splinter group]] is starting to gain power and attention, which preaches for shedding their humanity and turning machine.

Sitting atop lichen reliquary catacombs bears great risk to all involved. 
The continuing, and growing rate of undying arriving in their spaces is bound to cause housing and space issues sometime.
Rising instability from digging out more rooms without adequate support bears the risk of cave-ins. 
The deconstruction of former Tombstone buildings might also be lashing out to the subterranean areas.
