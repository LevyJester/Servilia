Any metabolic process produces this wave/particle called Amarisk. It\'s affected by gravity, and therefore accumulate around planets housing life.

It\'s emitted in larger quantities by neural activity, and scaling with the complexity of neural activity and cognition.

> Therefore, a planet housing sentient life is bound to accumulate a lot of Amarisk, as opposed to a planet with only rudimentary lifeforms such as bacteria.
