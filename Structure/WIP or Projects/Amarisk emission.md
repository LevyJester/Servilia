Any metabolic process produces this wave/particle called [[Amarisk]]. It\'s affected by gravity, and therefore accumulate around planets housing life. High concentrations of Amarisk will cause it to collapse unto itself, creating [[Ignition Events]]. 
It\'s emitted in larger quantities by neural activity, and scaling with the complexity of neural activity and cognition.

> Therefore, a planet fostering advanced, sentient life is bound to accumulate a lot of Amarisk, as opposed to a planet with only rudimentary lifeforms such as bacteria.
