I want to fly, I want to learn to fly. I have these wings, but they are shattered and limp. Someone must've ripped them off their original body, they're covered in blood. 
Healer, doctor, tell me, how can these wings heal?
They will not heal, they are dead, and starting to rot.
But doctor, there must be a way they can recover! I want to reach for the skies so bad... 
Hmm, I don't think so. Humans don't fly, do they? Na√Øve one, have you ever seen a flying human? That is what they tell in their fantastic stories and fairytales. 

Today I will write a message to the ones rumoured of twisting flesh and bone.
