#### Gauntlet Spellcasting, Weaving
1. Enable the implant to tap the twilit
2. Have the required conditions met for conducting twilit unscathed
    (you're causing a localised rift in spacetime in/on the implant)
3. Channel the Twilit through your body, and optionally, additional conductors (wires, veins, etc.)
4. Concentrate, focusing these energies through intense Intent and Will
5. Call forth to the [[Forces.canvas|Elemental Force]] one wishes to utilise by sacrificing a measure of material 
	Things the caster or force itself associates with the force, in order to gain benevolence.
6. Shift the focus of the twilit-indent with the desired element into articulation, such as hands and speech
7. Produce the Woven, the confined and suspended spell through articulation such as gestures or incantation
8. Release the Woven with Intent, defining its behaviour.
	Such as Projectile, Lingering mist, Self, etc.
	**OR** take the woven and cast it into a Cypher (or any other carrier) for later use
#### Arcane Material Studies
Organic and natural materials conduct twilit best, with the affinity declining until aversion/drawbacks occurring as the material is refined and worked further.
