The [[Faceless]] now haunting/residing within Tombstone are the successful [[Varuú|descendants]] of Lavish Pseudoneo technology applied on dragonborn, given twilight powers.


## Downfall
*[[Fall of the Lavish|During the end of the First Era]]*
The [[Fall|carnage]] brought upon them[^1] caused the few surviving citizens to go insane from the trauma, tearing themselves and their buildings to shreds. This caused the orderly disassembly of Tombstone.
