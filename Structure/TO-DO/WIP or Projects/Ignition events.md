#TODO 
As Amarisk accumulates and amasses itself (due not being consumed or decaying), it builds up until the mass collapses into itself.

These collapse events are called ignitions, and a advanced species\' amarisk sphere usually undergoes at least two ignitions.

It\'s a event akin to a vacuum implosion, which causes a rapid expansion afterwards.

## First Ignition
The first ignition event will imprint characteristics of the dominant species into the newly created twilight.
This will also cause the amarisk to amass in a plane unique to the planet, which is also created during the first ignition. It is specific and explicit to the dominant (sentient) species, and will not be accessible to other species without further means.

The second ignition event will occur once a assumingly global population has established itself. This will likely impact the original world, as the implosion character of the event is powerful enough to leak out of the twilight layer.

It\'s direct effects to the twilight are of huge importance: the second ignition merges all the imprinted Amarisk into a conscious entity, spanning the entire Amarisk sphere and twilight.

This event seeds a rare genetic strain or trait among their species (assuming they are carbon and DNA based), that will enable these individuals to interact with these parallel dimensions known as the twilight.

Any further events are not known to cause more major events (in the human twilight).

They add more depth to the twilight, to store the excess Amarisk generated.
