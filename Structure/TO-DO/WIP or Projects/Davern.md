A kingdom in a rather medieval state of development on transition to very very early tech, but already somewhat proficient in magic and stuff (present time). 
They are not driven towards technological and economical advancement due to an abundance of various arcane artefacts and relics and nationwide acceptance and teaching of the naturalist arts.

Current King only has daughters, one of which is almost engaged lesbian with another kingdom/nation (perhaps Frisco?) performing spy activities -> lesbionage (funny)
