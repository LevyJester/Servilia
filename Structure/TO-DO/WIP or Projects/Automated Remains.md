Various buildings and structures left around the continent by [someone long gone](The%20Lavish%20Empire). 
Most of them remain functional through the maintenance of peculiar critters and other creatures, which [I](Kookie,%20Mage) did not inspect closer yet. 
In this entry I will summarise the most notable ones i found repeatedly, and theorise their function. 


## Gun Installation
This impossible-to-deceive turret hoists one to four massive gun barrels, each longer than a man, each with a bigger diameter of my head. 
Atop the barrel array usually sits a metal sphere, through which's oculus a blind eye gazes at me.
It seems to chase after [light sources](Flare), and will attempt to turn the turret towards any light source it can see, but this usually fails due to the rotten machinery.
The smell of what I think is leaking blood mixed with oil is pungent, and hurts my nose.
