### current creation myth:
yaldabaoth (goddess of flesh) created humans, Mekhane gifted them machines and invention. Yaldabaoth intended them to be uncultured and rather wild, like animals. Mekhane wanted them to strive for greatness, using machines and the power of sciences. 
This led to a conflict, arms race and eventual escalation in global war between the both factions, devastating humanity as a whole (save for those species who were above human clashing).
Only splinter groups remained, but those are what know drives the CoTF, Nølka and Mekhanites. 
	the CoTF have formed as counterforce to the cold and the undying, as their fire rids the curse, and The Cold is a remnant of the lively weapons employed by the Nølka during the war. 
Mekhane shattered during this fight into many components and pieces, one of which drives the entire City Thylyist. Some managed to escape into the plane of Mechanus, others into the vast eternal sea. It is the duty and goal of the Mekhanites to reassemble him. 

and presumably the War of Flesh is the original event that turned Schi ut-Pulá depressed, as she did not foresee the followers of her "friends" annihilate each other. ~~shortly turned into the undying and such~~
the curse of the undead and the cold are the final retaliation strikes by the nolka against the people of mekhane, knowing they'll bring misery for eternity to come. 
### where do dragons and lavish come in?
honestly, fuck knows
though I'm thinking that the lavish took the ways of modifying the flesh from the Nølka and turned it into their powerful biotechnology. so I'm presuming that the flooding of the Palga basin happened after the War of Flesh, as humanity was decimated and no longer served a threat. From there on its known what happens, etc.

### dragons. 
for the time being I'm going to say that some gods/Schnūt collaborated on making a "ideal" species, which kinda failed once chromatic dragons started to exist. 
thing is that they're the oldest sentient species alive on Schi.
### Twilit 
about the twilight strain I'm assuming that within the great woe of Schi ut-Pula abandoning Schi greatly disturbed the young twilight, which made it leak into the population and effectively seeding the strain which resulted in Amarisk mages aka Sorcerers. 

due to Schi ut-pula forsaking herself the twilight lost it's anchor/grip on another entity to converse to, which greatly caused it to turn unstable in itself, as if abandoned by a parental figure ([[Echoes]]). the twilight also "gifted" humanity the ability to interacct with it, which turned out to be a one-sided relationship, which made it suffer further.
