[[Followers of Mekhane|Mekhanites]] advocate sapience, education and technology through constructs and arcane engineering. They view any life as tool or actor in a grand plan, which eventually shall bring forth [[Mekhane]]s Will and create the perfect machine. 
[[Nølkā]] aspire to become beasts, and consume all that is. Any living being that is not them is merely sought after as lowly food, and all [[Beyond]] considered the [ultimate challenge](obsidian://open?vault=Servilia&file=Theophagy%20or%20the%20Death%20of%20Divinity).
