Part of the [[Astral Ocean]] #Regions, subdivision of [[Ka√°-Rav]]. 

The ocean spans over the edges of multiple tectonic plates, and therefore has a high volcanic and geologic activity.
This shaped a high number of atolls and still-active volcanoes, and those atolls and islands feature astounding numbers of geysers, hot springs and alike.
A certain series of volcanoes and calderas is doused in abundance of mineral-sourced colours.


These bear a special trait: Observing a specific one being active causes a outburst of specific emotions in the observer, the emotions being associated to the observed colour.

Few sorcerers consider this the goal of a decade-long pilgrimage. 

*** 
*Future:*
Ground penetrating radar scans and analysis resulted that a anomalous object is buried in the magma chambers which channels a massive amount of Amarisk into the magma. This possibly makes the emotions associate to colours, and the activity of each caldera might be a way of the [[Twilit]] to express itself.
