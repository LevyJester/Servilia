#TODO 

Not too far away from the [[Chromatic Calderas]] is a cluster of atolls, which are common residence to Antares.
This area is differing from the rest of the ocean itself, as only dead and distant stars (from outside the milky way) shine. This usually confuses seafarers who orient themselves on constellations.

Additionally, the atoll easily obscures one's mind, lightly acting as anti-memetic effect.

It is said that this area has been neglected by [[The Navigator]] due to the absence of common constellations.
