A wide-spanning forest ecosystem, including rain-forest but also temperate towards Mediterranean plant life.
It's called the Ninth forest because it's on Number Nine if the Realm is abstracted onto the dial of a clock.
Central to it is the Green Swale of Seven (nine?) Spires.

Colloquially dubbed "Jungle of Megaliths" due to many massive rocky spires scattered throughout, whose origins or purpose remain unknown and forgotten.
