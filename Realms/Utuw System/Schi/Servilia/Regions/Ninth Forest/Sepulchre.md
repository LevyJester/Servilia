##  The undying City
#Undead #SettlementsÂ #Faction

The main settlement [^1] for victims of the [[Curse of the Undead]].

Only a smaller fraction of the residents voluntarily lives here, most of them got forcibly sent here.

It's underground, and they have a small religion going on, but it drifted too far into states that a alive and integer mind cannot parse.
*+1d4 insanity on inspect*
The main place of worship of their religion is said to be built atop a lich tomb, who has been cemented there before the Great Woe [^2].  

[^1]:Rather a ghetto, but the feelings of understanding and community are attractive nevertheless.
[^2]:When Schi-Ut-Pula sold the world, giving way to the downfall of Death. 


Some of the residents are badly suffering from being [[Hollowed]]. The Hollowed are still treated with respect and care, similar to Alzheimer or dementia patients IRL.

Generally, the bearers that didn't loose it yet are partially depressed about the seemingly inevitable decay of their kin, and therefore see the contact to the Children of the Flame as revelation/salvation, as this is capable of saving their folk.


### Activities of Citizens
##### 'Sinners'
A brighter faction of them are using their pseudo-eternal life to do what they never could've done, such as:
-   Bodily pleasures
-   "Sex, drugs, rock and roll"
-   "sinful" activities
However, this particular kind falls easily for hubris and is commonly detained (as those fall for hollowing quick).
#### Artisan work and Research 
Vastly more common than those 'sinful' people are those that dedicate their seemingly-eternal life towards craftsmanship, wizardry and research, which has earned Sepulchre as a whole a status of small, but highly renown expertise.
The scientists of Duley and -Port and Sepulchre are in close-knit contact, driving innovation. 

A rouge splinter group of Dwarves has settled within the laboratories of Sepulchre, supplying them with materials and their bodies for study.
