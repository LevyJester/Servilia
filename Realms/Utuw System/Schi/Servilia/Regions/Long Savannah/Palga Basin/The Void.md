*Note: This refers to the location, for the Entity assoicated, read [[Voidfish]].*
When completely delved through all layers of  [[The Twilight]], people could access [[The Void]].
 Accessible through the [[Fountainhead]]'s borehole, [[The Abyss]].
 The [[Voidfish]] is this plane's #Shnūt .

Supposedly only [[Vessels]] or hollows can stay here without being torn apart or going insane.
Hollows quickly turn into vessels when contacting the Void.

The counteracting force to all that is matter, therefore archenemy to [[Schi ut-Pula]] and all of the [[Material Plane]].
