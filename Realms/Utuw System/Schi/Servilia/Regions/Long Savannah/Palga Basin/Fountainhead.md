#Void #locations #Ruin 

This is basically a interdimensional drilling rig that leads to [[Twilit]] and eventually, the void.
The borehole is [[The Abyss|physically accessible]]. 
 

And now that the [[The Lavish Empire]] aren't here to maintain the catalyst of the Fountainhead the whole Between creatures (and -energies) come crawling through the wastes, turning everything hollow


> #QUEST: retrieve the Catalyst from ??? And repair the Fountainhead
>
> #QUEST: Destroy and seal the Fountainhead

 


The Wastes around the FH have become gliss, a substance with close to zero physical properties, thus, no colour or friction
