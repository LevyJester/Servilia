#Amida 
Big if not titanic semi-organic and sentient supercomputers that search for a solution to the [[Curse of the Undead]]. Their entire structure each houses a sector of Amida, as they govern infrastructure.
Numerators were able to interact with the control of the [[SC-AM]] project and tap the power output for [[Amida]].
Most of the heat produced is absorbed by purposed [[The Cold]] tissue to recuperate energy and not to devastate the environment like Rainworld.

Modified Cold tissue has been tamed to form transport pathways throughout each Numerator structure; Strands and bundles of neurons, veins and other capillary paths facilitate most matter and information (including civilian) transport within each numerator.
General population is aware of the rough task of the numerators but they don't really care other than for housing and utilities. 

As each Numerator is sentient, they shifted and changed their structure to reflect themselves, which led to the erratic and organic looks of Amida. 
In addition, a Numerator is very much capable of gatekeeping it's population.
