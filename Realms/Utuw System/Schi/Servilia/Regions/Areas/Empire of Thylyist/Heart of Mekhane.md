A large sphere of rotating gears and ticking escapements, crafted from brass and inscribed with glowing runes. *No-one seems to know who created it, nor when, nor its purpose.* %%TBD, #TODO%%
It slowly rotates around itself, suspended by axles, crankshafts and other mechanical connections. 

It is hidden deep within the [innards](Citadel%20of%20the%20Gear.md) of Thylyist and amongst the most-guarded locations of the entire city-state. 

Perceiving it is only granted to the highest Mekhanites who wish to be granted divine inspiration.
