*A big, chaotically built mansion, towering over the nearby lake.*
*It emanates a warm and homely feel. Maybe you want to come inside?*

This mansion or house was built long ago by now long forgotten noble people.
They seem to had powerful knowledge over arcane architecture, as the entire building seems to be capable of sensing its environment and inhabitants.

It's build on a strong, almost untouched, nigh raw stone foundation.

Closer inspection reveals that every material is in a similar state to the foundation, seemingly directly put into place without further manufacturing.

*Upon casting a spell or working magic within:*
> Something is off... you don't feel the usual exhaustion coming with magic.
> What was that?
> Did the floor panels just... flap?


Built next and over to a small lake, with wooden struts and stone pillars holding the twined building stable.

Across the sea, from over the pier reaching into the water, I spot a tall figure in a boat, seemingly adrift. They are one to carry a weighty bag, through which i spot movement. At the blink of my eyes the boat is set asunder, an i fear the well-being of this man and his ominous cargo. I long to reach to him, lest I cannot, for he is leagues away.
