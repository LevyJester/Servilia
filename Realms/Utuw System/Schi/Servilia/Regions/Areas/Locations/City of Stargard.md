### Overview
A community of isolated and deranged sorcerers who devote their time towards the study and use of celestial bodies and formations. A decent part of their population is made from other outcasts and strangers.  
The only remaining actively practising guild for Astral Sorcery.
Townsfolk and activity are only seen past sundown and cease after sunrise; during the day, every citizen sleeps until nightfall. There are only few accommodations and housing-for-hire that offer a "normal" opening schedule for foreigners.
### Location
Situated on the [[Kaá-Rav|southern island]], peacefully coexisting with the dragons, which occasionally come to visit. Trade between the two groups is rare, but easily possible. 
### Architecture
The city is defined by the heavy use of marble, basalt and black granite, which has been chiselled into ornate masonry and temples around each corner. Many of the major roads and arches are embossed with [[Bar of Ithildine|Ithildine]] to improve the astral channelling. Many-a-so shapes on buildings resemble symbols or other icons of extraplanetary objects like the moons, other planets, stars, and so on. 

They value symmetry a lot, and thus, Stargard looks like a puzzle of geometric shapes when viewed aerially. However, the distinct arrangement and patterning is clearly visible once noticed. 
Each temple here is dedicated towards a constellation and it's associated effects, and built as such.

### Notable Locations
##### The Light Merchant
A two-storey building of timber and brick walls, the shop of a male dwarv weapon merchant named Gastno. It is said to be built atop a crater where a piece of the sun (Utuw) fell to Schi long ago, and everything Gastno sells glows with white light for a year and a day. To reinforce the rumours, nothing around the building grows, not even the hardiest of weeds, as if the ground was completely scorched. 
Unsurprisingly, he specialises in peddling wares related to light/darkness, such as blinds, candles, glowing rocks...

An overgrown temple ruin, which appears restored upon the night of the equinox. Various attempts at identifying the deity or alignment of this temple have been made, but all failed. 

A ruined tower of shattered stone walls, said to be haunted by the ghost of the last empress of a long-forgotten empire. Offerings placed in the crudely-worked altar will be gone by the next full moon, but no one proofed if it actually is the bespoke ghost or just beggars. 
##### The Oculus of Night
Close to the centre of Stargard, this dome resides with a circular opening at its centre, supported by a ring of caryatid columns. The sky seen through the oculus is perpetually dark, marked by strange, foreign constellations of stars. Through intricate mechanisms, the entire dome can shift and turn, changing its viewport towards other sections of the sky. During day, the "eyelids", two hemispheres, close over the dome through a unseen force. 
The foundation of this dome is made from soot-covered marble, embossed with plenty of Ithildine. This embossment seems to shape some pattern towards the aperture of the dome, but they break off before touching the eyelids or 'eyeball' itself.  
##### Apollean Gateway 
A arch build from a white, almost bleached, porous stone. It is rumoured to be the rock of Opar, brought down upon mankind from a deity beyond. Any attempts at moving it proved unsuccessful, as it resists any force on it. Every full moon of any moon, the content of the arch fills itself with a barely visible, but tangible mist.
