#Faction 
A kingdom in a rather medieval state of development on transition to very very early tech (read: sophisticated agriculture), but already proficient in magic and other studies (present time). 
They are not driven towards technological and economical advancement due to an abundance of various arcane artefacts and relics and nationwide acceptance and teaching of the naturalist arts. 
This gives them a peculiar state of suspended development, as their artefacts and alike allow them to stay at their current state.
The only currently-present faction openly accepting the practices of Flesh, as per the [[Nølkā]]. 

Current King only has daughters, one of which is almost engaged lesbian with another kingdom/nation (perhaps Frisco?) performing spy activities -> lesbionage (funny)

A lot of local mythology revolves around their deceased and deified [[The Old King|Old King]], who lived through most of the first era up until recently. His rather mystified death left Davern uncoordinated and headless. 

Their capital, [[Auvergne]], is home to the royal family. 
A long-forgotten cruelty is hidden below the Davernian Fort, that being a [[ancient dragon of Auvergne|prisoner]] of a [[Nølkā-Mekhanite War|old war.]]
