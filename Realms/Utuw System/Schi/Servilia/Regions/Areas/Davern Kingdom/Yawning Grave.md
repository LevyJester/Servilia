Buried asunder lie [[The Old King]]s fleshy remains. 
Stripped off their bones, they remain chained to the throne. 
Left conscious, aware, missing their significant others parts, yet dreaming, yawning.
Why is it sleeping? 
To dispel the churning thoughts and worries brought unto themselves?
Placed into eternal hibernation, in the wait for the world?
Laid dormant, eagerly awaiting a reunion with its skeleton? 
One daring enough may listen to the babbling of His corpse in its perpetual sleep.
